a)
The program didn't work properly, 
processtransactions function only used the methods of the class base class, 
and not the methods of the chequingsaccount class.

b)
The program still isn't working properly, 
even after making the methods in the account base class virtual.
This is because the account is being passed to the processtransaction by value as a base account object, 
so the methods of the chequingaccount are getting sliced.
